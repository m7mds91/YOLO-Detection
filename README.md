# Advanced Camera YOLO Detection

This project is a Python PyQt5-based graphical interface that:
âœ… Selects between IP, RTSP, or USB cameras  
âœ… Runs YOLOv8 object detection (supports small, medium, large models)  
âœ… Displays human, car, and ship detections with count icons  
âœ… Supports GPU (CUDA) or CPU inference  
âœ… Saves user settings and last-used camera configuration  
âœ… Includes a splash screen with configurable app logo  

---

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Real-time video stream from USB, IP, or RTSP cameras  
- âœ… Model switcher (YOLOv8s, YOLOv8m, YOLOv8l) for performance vs. accuracy  
- âœ… Sidebar with toggleable object detections: human, car, ship  
- âœ… Right-click on video window: toggle detection lines, change resolution (HD, FHD, 4K)  
- âœ… Menu bar: switch processing mode (CPU/GPU), change logo, save settings  
- âœ… Configuration saved in `config.json` for session persistence
